# v00-12

* 2025-05-28 Victor Schwan ([PR#240](https://github.com/key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper/pull/240))
  - Introduced a `NamedTuple` (`ColDrawConfig`) to capture the true substructure of each configuration entry.
  - Refactored the configuration list to be a list of these structured entries.
  - Added a one-liner flattening back to the old list format for backward compatibility with legacy code.
  - General code formatting
  
  Previously, the configuration was stored as one extremely long, flat list, ignoring the logical grouping of each entryâ€™s components (name, marker type, size, CED draw layer). This mismatch caused multiple problems:
  
  - Autoformatters spread the list over many lines.
  - Workarounds like disabling autoformatting on this section were a hotfix, not a real solution.

* 2025-05-27 Thomas Madlener ([PR#241](https://github.com/key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper/pull/241))
  - Switch to an Ubuntu 24 runner to run pre-commit

* 2025-05-22 Thomas Madlener ([PR#237](https://github.com/key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper/pull/237))
  - Make sure that Link collections are properly skipped from conversion if they already exist in the LCIO event

* 2025-04-29 Thomas Madlener ([PR#234](https://github.com/key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper/pull/234))
  - Introduce the `io_helpers.IOHandlerHelper` class that makes it possible to more easily transparently handle LCIO and EDM4hep inputs and outputs as well as the necessary conversions between them.
    - Fully based on the `IOSvc` so that the `PodioInput`, `PodioOutput` and `k4DataSvc` are no longer necessary for mixing and matching
  - Deprecate the `inputReader` module and suggest people to switch to the `io_helpers` instead.

* 2025-04-03 Thomas Madlener ([PR#230](https://github.com/key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper/pull/230))
  - Replace instances of `InitializeDD4hep` processors with `GeoSvc` and `TrackingCellIDEncodingSvc` (if necessary) in the conversion of Marlin steering files to Gaudi options files.

* 2025-03-28 Thomas Madlener ([PR#233](https://github.com/key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper/pull/233))
  - Unconditionally check the TES when looking for EDM4hep collections to convert in case `convertAll` is set to `True`.
  - Restructure conversion slightly and only do this lookup once and cache the results from the first conversion. This is possible since event contents are assumed to be constant.

* 2025-03-11 Thomas Madlener ([PR#232](https://github.com/key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper/pull/232))
  - Improve the debug log message for where EventHeader collections are converted to.

* 2025-03-11 Thomas Madlener ([PR#229](https://github.com/key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper/pull/229))
  - Make sure to read the `"EventHeader"` collection in the tests as it will be converted unconditionally and lead to termination if it's not found.

* 2025-03-11 Thomas Madlener ([PR#228](https://github.com/key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper/pull/228))

* 2025-03-11 Mateusz Jakub Fila ([PR#227](https://github.com/key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper/pull/227))
  - Update docs to use `IOSvc` instead of `k4DataSvc`. Use`IOSvc` by the default in the examples

* 2025-03-11 jmcarcell ([PR#225](https://github.com/key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper/pull/225))
  - Fix missing collections with IOSvc when using `convertAll=True`
  - Add a test that would fail without this fix
  - Rename `PseudoRecoAlgorithm` to `PseudoRecoFunctional` and create a new  `PseudoRecoAlgorithm` that implements a `Gaudi::Algorithm`

* 2025-02-21 Thomas Madlener ([PR#223](https://github.com/key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper/pull/223))
  - EDM4hep2Lcio: Make an exception message more useful by including the collection name for which retrieval fails

* 2025-02-17 Thomas Madlener ([PR#221](https://github.com/key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper/pull/221))
  - Fix the `trackerHitPlanes` name of the map going from EDM4hep to LCIO to make it work properly.
  - Remove some no longer necessary special handling of ParticleID and TrackerHitPlane maps.

* 2025-02-17 Thomas Madlener ([PR#220](https://github.com/key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper/pull/220))
  - Add a `skipNEvents` property to the `LcioEvent` algorithm to make it possible to skip the first N input LCIO events.
    - Assuming default algorithm name, `--LcioEvent.skipNEvents=<N>` can be used to change this parameter from the command line.

* 2025-02-10 jmcarcell ([PR#218](https://github.com/key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper/pull/218))
  - Try to retrieve the MetadataSvc only when not using PodioDataSvc to avoid a lookup error when using the Marlin wrapper.

# v00-11

* 2025-02-06 Thomas Madlener ([PR#217](https://github.com/key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper/pull/217))
  - Require the minimal version of k4EDM4hep2LcioConv to be 0.11 as that is a working tag

* 2025-02-05 jmcarcell ([PR#216](https://github.com/key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper/pull/216))
  - Add support for running the wrapper with `IOSvc` with a few tests:
    - Run the CLIC reconstruction with `IOSvc` (proves processors run under IOSvc, producing the same output).
    - Run `global_converter_maps` with `IOSvc`, where a functional algorithm produces output that is used by a Marlin processor and the output of the two is used either by a `Gaudi::Algorithm` or a functional algorithm (proves processors can take input from functional algorithms and functional algorithms can take input from processors).
    - Run `test_link_conversion_edm4hep` with `IOSvc`, where links produced by functional algorithms are checked by Marlin processors.

* 2024-12-16 Thomas Madlener ([PR#210](https://github.com/key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper/pull/210))
  - Stop the reading of the LCIO events early enough, such that no empty event is processed after the last event (which breaks "regular" Algorithms in the same chain)
  - Make it a hard error (exception) when reading an event fails
  - Add documentation about the small conceptual differences that might lead to unexpected results

* 2024-12-15 Mateusz Jakub Fila ([PR#213](https://github.com/key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper/pull/213))

* 2022-12-19 Thomas Madlener ([PR#100](https://github.com/key4hep/k4MarlinWrapper/pull/100))
